Installation
------------

1. Locate your Sublime Text packages folder: in windows it will be 
   something like `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages`, in linux it 
   will be `$HOME/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages/Nimrod/`, in MacOSX
   it is `/Users/{user}/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`.
   You can also open the "Preferences" menu and choose "Browse Packages...";

2. Put a copy of this repository in a "Nimrod" folder;

3. You are done!

I hope it will be useful!

I've started from the ASP (gasp!) mode by Rich Barton. The list
of keywords is taken from the 
[Nimrod Manual](http://nimrod-code.org/manual.html).
